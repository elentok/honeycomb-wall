# Honeycomb Storage Wall Attachments

A collection of parametric attachments for the [Honeycomb Storage Wall][1]:

- Pliers holder

## Originals

The "originals" directory includes some of the original STL and SCAD files (so I'd
I'd have them in one place):

- [honeycomb_wall.scad][2] - parameterized OpenSCAD version of the honeycomb
  storage wall.
- [honeycomb_wall_6x7.stl][2] - A small 6x7 honeycomb wall (can easily be
  printed by a Prusa Mini in an apparently too-confined enclosure). Rotate the Z axis by 90
  degrees to give it even more space.
- [insert-countersunk.stl][1] - The base 1x1 insert from the original
  project that attaches the honeycomb wall to the wall behind it.
- [insert-{m3,m4,empty}.stl][1] - The base 1x1 inserts from the original
  project.
- [small-tool-holder.stl][3] - The small tool holder by [@WhatWouldAnEngineerD][4],
  useful for small files and a tweezer.
